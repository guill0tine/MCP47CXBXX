This library is used to communicate between an arduino Uno and the Microchip MCP47CXBXX series of DACs such as
- MCP47CXB0X (8-bit)
- MCP47CXB1X (10-bit)
- MCP47CXB2X (12-bit)

This library has only been tested with PN MCP47CVB12-E/MF which is a 10-bit 2 channel DAC.
Writen by Alfredo to us in one of the projects he is working on.

Place the library folder in your arduinosketchfolder/libraries/ folder, usually located in the documents folder.
You may need to create the libraries subfolder if its your first library. Restart the IDE.
